Right now I am trying to diversify my skills by working on projects across different platforms and languages.
My dream is to become a full stack developer 💻

* Learning Operating systems, Machine Learning, and Low Level Programming 🌱

## Projects I'm most proud of 💪

**Pong Clone**
> Primary language: c++
>
> This project was my first attempt at building an actual application with c++. It turned out really well
> * two players
> * ball is hit back and forth at variable speed and direction

**Android Books Reader**
> Primary languages: Kotlin Java
>
> I wanted to make an app that could store all the books I was reading in one place and
> back up the files on the cloud. My solution was to make my own that could have the UI I wanted
> and could save my files in case I lost my phone.
>
> * Uploads files of various types
> * Allows for reading and downloading stored books
> * Made sure the UI was appealing and simple
> * Uses firebase auth to ensure collections stay private
> * Files accessible from any device

**Russian autocompleter**
> Primary languages: C#, Python(just to make the databse), SQLite
>
> I needed an autocomplete bar for one of my other projects, so I got the idea to make my own
> and use it as I needed. I made it to work with the russian alphabet (33 letters) but changing that
> for other data is pretty simple.
>
> * Quickly gives a list of suggestions
> * The suggestions can be selected with tab or click
> * Works extremely fast using a Trie data structure
> * Queries a database of 10,000 words (collected from webscraping)
> * The end result is a very effecient autocomplete bar that can work well with any project

**Chrome Extension Word-Chad**
> Primary language: Typescript
>
> I wanted to make a deploy a simple dictionary chome extension that can look up words and give
> pronounciations. The end result turned out really well.
>
> * It can look up a highlighted word when you click the icon
> * Gives definitions usages and pronounciation
> * Workst seemlessly in chrome browser
> * It will be deployed on the chrome store soon

**Digital assistant software _Cheron_**
>Primary languages: Python, C#
>
> This software is supposed to interface with a simple arduino robot that will process audio commands. The end goal is
> a customizable at home assistant that can search files and open applications
>
> * So far the hardware for Cheron is still being worked on
> * The software can open applications and search for files using python
> * Data is managed and stored locally on a SQLite database
> * The chatroom reads input and updates the database automatically with user and Cheron messages
